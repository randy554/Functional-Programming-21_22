# Functional-Programming
This is a repo for the course **Functional Programming:** `@CMD Hogeschool van Amsterdam`.
During this course topics such as **functional programming**, **cleaning data** and creating **data visualisations** will be be addressed. Through the [Wiki](https://github.com/randy554/Functional-Programming-21_22/wiki) I will share my progress and findings.
