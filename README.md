# Functional-Programming
This is a repo for the course **Functional Programming:** `@CMD Hogeschool van Amsterdam`.
During this course topics such as **functional programming**, **cleaning data** and creating **data visualisations** will be be addressed. Through the [Wiki](https://github.com/randy554/Functional-Programming-21_22/wiki) I will share my progress and findings.

 ## Concept
 
 ### [Live demo](https://randy554.github.io/Functional-Programming-21_22/)
 
 ## Dataset
 

To master the basics of functional programming and to practice cleaning data, I will use the tech track survey dataset. This is a survey that was conducted among students of the CMD program at the HVA who follow the Tech Track. Below is a snippet of the [dataset](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-21-22/blob/main/tech-track-dataset.json):
